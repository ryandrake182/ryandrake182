This profile will likely never contain any public repositories, but below are some stats which includes everything from my private repositories. 
<br /><br />I use GitHub mainly for my collection of self-written PowerShell scripts from over the years, for work -- but I also use it for my personal website, the main branch of which is auto-deployed to my production environment running on AWS Amplify.
